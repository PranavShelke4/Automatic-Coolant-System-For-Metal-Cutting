# Automatic Coolant System For Metal Cutting

In traditional metal cutting processes, coolants are manually supplied to reduce the heat generated during the cutting process. However, this method has several limitations, including the wastage of coolant and metal, as well as the potential for worker exposure to harmful chemicals.

To overcome these challenges, an IoT-based automatic coolant system for metal cutting has been developed. This system enables automatic coolant supply during metal cutting, thereby reducing the wastage of coolant and metal. Additionally, the system allows for remote monitoring and alert notifications to be sent to the user's mobile phone, allowing them to keep track of the coolant supply and metal cutting process from a distance.

Furthermore, the system allows the user to select the type of metal being cut, and accordingly set the threshold for coolant supply. This helps to ensure that the coolant is supplied in the optimal quantity, thereby reducing wastage and ensuring the safety of the metal being cut.

Overall, this system offers several benefits over traditional coolant supply methods, including improved efficiency, reduced wastage, and increased safety for workers.
